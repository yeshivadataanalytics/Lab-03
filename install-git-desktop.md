Follow the steps (there are 7, but none are that complicated) below to create the needed local GitHub repository and push it out the cloud for public sharing. If you've only ever worked on the GitHub website, you might be missing out!

If you’re already a git pro...
•	Jump to step 5 below, but do share the link to your public GitHub repo.
If you get stuck...
•	Begin by calmly reading through the GitHub desktop guides (Links to an external site.).
•	Only after you've done that, ask for help from your colleagues or professor in Community using the topic "Installation".
•	Working through error messages and frustrations is an important part of this and every programming course you'll take!
So without further adieu...
Step 1: Create a GitHub account (if you haven't already)
Visit GitHub.com (Links to an external site.) and click the "sign up" button.
Step 2: Download GitHub desktop tool
Your work this semester depends on you frequently syncing your local filesystem to a GitHub-hosted repository. Download GitHub desktop for your OS.
Step 3: Open GitHub Dekstop
When prompted, sign in to GitHub.com, so that you can work more effortlessly, without putting your username and password in every time. Now, we're ready to create our course repository.
Step 4: Determine your Local Parent Directory
Figure out where in your local computer you’d like to store the “Analytics-Programming” (or similarly named) directory that will hold assignments and other files for this class.
•	Maybe you want your class folder to live inside “Documents”, or in a sub-folder, you choose somewhere else on your computer.
Step 5: Create a Local Course Repository
•	In GitHub Desktop, go to File, choose New Repository. Or if you're on the "let's get started!" screen, click "create a new repository on your hard drive.
•	Give your new repository a helpful name, like “Analytics-Programming”, as well as a description.
•	Indicate the Local Path by navigating to the parent directory you chose in Step 4 (like “Documents” or “Desktop”).
•	Click “initialize with README”, and leave everything else to default.
•	Then click Create Repository.
Congratulations, you have a new repository!
Step 6: Create a Public Remote Repository
If you’ve set up GitHub Desktop with your login credentials, you can very easily just hit the “Publish” button, and you’ll push that repository to the cloud, and the two will be linked! Just make sure to uncheck the box that would make the repository private.
Step 7: Visit Your Cloud Repository
•	Navigate to your GitHub.com account and you should see your new repository! Simple, right?
•	Double-check that it’s a public, not private, repository by checking in Settings.
A good organizational method would be to make a new folder (say, “module_1”) for every assignment, and add files and folders within that folder. Then you have simple file organization, and you can easily grab the URL for just a single file or folder to submit to your instructor.
However, just be aware that empty folders won’t get published from your local computer to GitHub.com. You didn’t make a mistake! So don’t panic if your great directory organization structure doesn’t show up… it will, once those folders have files.
•	If you're feeling particularly advanced, you can add an empty file named .gitkeep (the dot is important!) to an otherwise empty folder to make sure GitHub will show your folder structure, but this is completely optional.
Feeling a little lost? 
Try giving https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/ (Links to an external site.) a read for a description of git basics and how git and GitHub work together.

As a community of learners, we'll learn from each other's code as well as from more formal sources like our textbook. To that end, let's all share our public GitHub accounts.
This will also prove that you've completed the necessary steps to begin working with this important tool. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, you can optionally create a README for your repository, or create a folder structure (with .gitkeep or some other 'dot' file used to make sure folders aren't empty and therefore disregarded by GitHub). 
Here's what to do:
•	Find and comment on our M0 Proof of GitHub pin in Community. Don't create a new pin!
•	In your comment, provide the URL of your GitHub repository for this course.
Please complete ASAP, but definitely prior to our M1 Live Session.
